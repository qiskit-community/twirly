    This descriptor is similar to the :func:`functools.cached_property` descriptor, except that the
    cache lives on the owner rather than the instance. Moreover, if the owner has an attribute
    called ``num_qubits``, then the output is cached for each unique (stringified) value of this
    attribute. Hence, the property value is borg-like, and so that this descriptor can only be
    safely used in cases where some guarantee can be made that the output of the method depends on
    no more than the value of ``num_qubits``.ÃŸ

    ``property`` is used as the parent to get increase support for linting.
